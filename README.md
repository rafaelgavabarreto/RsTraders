# RsTraders

The RsTraders website was built with the intention of being a learning tool in cryptocurrency investment. I was responsible for the initial idea and for the whole backend. I also built the blockchain, blocks and in the transactions I designed so that we store all the transactions of buying and selling of cryptocurrency. Enjoy! :)
